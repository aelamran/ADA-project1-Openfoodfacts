# Food For Good
## Abstract
In this project, we are going to dig deeply into the several pieces of information we have about food that is registered in the openfoodfact dataset. Our goal is to identify the diversity of food and to do some analysis based on different macros these food provide and also on different micros. Indeed, we want to show how much these two axes are important in rating the quality of the food we eat. We would like to classify the food into some macro/micro categories and define some useful metrics to rate this food.

## Research Questions
- Are there some products that don’t indicate the nutritional facts? Isn’t that mandatory?
- How are the products grades distributed on the nutrition scale (A to E)? Are there more products with a good or a bad score?
- What are the main differences between French & UK regulations in the evaluation of nutritional contents of foods? (nutrition score defined by the UK Food Standards Administration vs the one adapted for the French market)
- What are the goods that have the highest carbon footprint? How do we calculate the carbon footprint? What do we include? 
- What are the socio-economic factors that influence food choice?
- What are the worst ingredients products in everyday products? (carcinogens ingredients, products that contain palm oil, etc)
- Which products promote malnutrition?
- How does food quality change over the years?
- Analyse the quality of products over years for every different label/organization and do a parallel analysis of this with what’s happening in the world. 

## Dataset

## A list of internal milestones until project milestone 2(25th November)

- Download the required data, Collect it and do some exploration in order to clean it in a sufficient way.
- Sight the data and do some preliminary analysis.
- Define macro/micros food categories.
- Define some first metrics to rate food.
- Classify the quality of food.
- Dig into micro/macro of food.
- Explore some good visualization tools.

## Questions for TAs

- Are these research questions/list of internal milestones enough to do a good project?
- What are the most important aspects of analysis and visualization of this dataset?
- Do we need to use some distributed systems (spark) to deal with this data?
