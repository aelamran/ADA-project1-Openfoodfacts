# Food For Good
## Abstract
In this project, we are going to dig deeply into the several pieces of information we have about the products that are registered in the open food fact dataset. Our goal is to identify the diversity of food and to do some analysis, based on the different macros these different types of food provide and also on their micros. Indeed, we want to show how much these two axes are important to rate the quality of the food we eat. We would also like to classify it into some macro/micro categories and define some useful metrics to rate the products.

## Research Questions
- Are there some products that don’t indicate the nutritional facts? Isn’t that legally mandatory?
- How are the products grades distributed on the nutrition scale (A to E)? Are there more products with good or bad scores?
- What are the main differences between French & British regulations in the evaluation of nutritional contents of foods? (regarding the nutrition score defined by the UK Food Standards Administration vs the one adapted for the French market)
- What are the goods that have the highest carbon footprint? How do we calculate the carbon footprint? What do we include? 
- What are the socio-economic factors that influence food choice?
- What are the worst ingredients used in everyday products? (carcinogens ingredients, products that contain palm oil, etc) Are they prevalent?
- Which products contribute to malnutrition?
- How does food quality change over the years?
- How does the quality of products evolve over the years depending on the label/organization and the world news?

## Dataset

## A list of internal milestones until project milestone 2(25th November)

- Download the required data, collect it and do some exploration in order to clean it efficiently.
- Sight the data and do some preliminary analysis.
- Define macro/micros food categories.
- Define some metrics to rate the products.
- Classify the quality of the food.
- Explore the data using some good visualization tools.

## Questions for TAs

- Are these research questions/list of internal milestones enough to do a good project?
- What are the most important aspects of the analysis and visualization of this dataset?
- Do we need to use some distributed systems (spark) to deal with this data?
