## Abstract

In this project, we are going to dig deeply into the several pieces of information we have about the products that are registered in the open food fact dataset. Our goal is to identify the impact of the food products that we consume on the Human Health, focusing on the composition of the food we eat, based on the different macros these different types of food provide and other concerning ingredients. The ultimate purpose being making better and healthier food choices.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this study is acquired from [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data). Open Food Facts is a food products database made by everyone, for everyone. It is a free, online and crowdsourced database of food products from around the world. Hence, you can use it to make better food choices, and as it is open data, anyone can re-use it for any purpose.

## Plan 

1. Quality of food
* Products containing additives.
* Products containing palm oil.
* Where are these products from?
    - The represented countries in our dataset
    - Additives by country
    - Palm oil by country 
* Nutritional values (a, b, c, d, e)
    - Distribution of nutritional values over some categories.
    - Distribution of some principal nutritional features over healthy unhealthy products. 
2. Carbon Footprint:
* the goods with the highest carbon footprint.
3. Advices for customers

## Milestone 3

* Sight the data and improve our analysis.
* Classify the quality of the food.
* Continue exploring the data using some good visualisation tools.
* Advice for customers : what to look for in a product, what are the red flags, important metrics.

# Some results

Several results can be concluded from our research : 

* The categories of products with the highest (average) amount of additives are Sugary snacks and Desserts.
* Same for products containing ingredients coming from Palm oil.
* France and the US are the most represented countries in the dataset in terms of ingredients with a high amount of additives.
* France, Switzerland and Belgium are the countries that have the most products with ingredients containing palm oil.
* African countries have also a high rate of ingredients with additives.
* Plant-based-and-Beverages products have the most number of product with grade A (with also a high amount of bad products with C and D grade).
* Beverages and Sugary snacks are the worst products (high amount of products of grade E).
* The top 3 categories of products containing palm oil and additives have mostly bad products.
* Healthy products have hight amount of proteins, carbohydrates and some fats but really small amounts of sugar and salt, the oppose it is true for bad products (less important macros and lots of sugar and salt)
* Fat, Saturated Fat and Sugar are predominant in unhealthy products compared to healthy ones. And healthy products have hight amount of proteins.
* The highest amounts of carbon Footprint are highly contained in meat and processed meats.
* The snacks that have the best grades are the ones that have labels like Organic, Low Sugar or Vegetarian.

**In the end, the labels found on products can give a hint about whether it is healthy or not, but to be really sure one needs to check all the relevant information about additives, fats, sugar content, palm oil etc.**
